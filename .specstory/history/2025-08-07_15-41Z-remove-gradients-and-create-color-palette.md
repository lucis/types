I'll help you remove the gradients and apply your color palette to the TypesPhilosophy component. Let me first read the current component to understand its structure.

---

Read file: undefined

---

Now, let me check the Tailwind configuration to add the custom color palette:

---



---

Let me check if there's a tailwind config at the root or in the view folder:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory undefined â€¢ **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Let me check if Tailwind is configured in styles.css:

---

Read file: undefined

---

Now I need to create a Tailwind configuration file to add the custom color palette, and then update the TypesPhilosophy component to use these colors instead of gradients. Let me first create the Tailwind config:

---



---

Now let me update the TypesPhilosophy component to use the new color palette instead of gradients:

---



---

Let me read the file again to see the current state:

---

Read file: undefined

---

I see the issue - the button element is split across multiple lines. Let me try a more comprehensive approach with the correct multi-line formatting:

---



---

Now let's continue with more edits to replace the gradients in the rest of the component:

---



---

Now let's update the HistoricalFoundations component section:

---



---

Let's continue updating the text content and remaining gradient sections in the HistoricalFoundations component:

---



---

Now let's update the ProgrammingLanguages component:

---



---

Due to the length of the file, I'll continue with a few more key sections to update. Let me update the CognitiveTyping component:

---



---

Now let me update the Conclusion section to complete the main color updates:

---



---

Now let's check if there are any linting errors to fix:

---



---

Let's also check the Tailwind config for any issues:

---



---

Now let's run the development server to test our changes:

---

```bash
cd /Users/lucis/deco/types && npm run dev
```
